# Mastermind Version 1.0 

Mastermind is a ruby version of the board game mastermind.

Mastermind has 3 levels of difficulties "Easy", "Hard" and "SUPER HARD". You'll be able to select which mode you want to play as soon as the game begins.

The game begins with a menu that will allow you to get instructions, pick a difficulty level, and play the game. After you win the game, you will be redirected to that menu.

Basic Intrustions:
"I have generated a sequence with a certain number of elements and amounts based on the difficulty levels. You have to guess what that sequence is. I will tell you when you are right and when you are wrong"
